            <p>
              I am Mojo Jojo. I have many talents, one of them being Akunna's trusted sidekick. My mission? 
              To keep her motivated and focused every single day. First things first, I check in with her: 
              "How are you feeling today darling?" Then, we set the tone for the week ahead with her goal. 
              With a sprinkle of motivation, I remind her of her strength. And to top it off, I suggest
              resources and a book from her shelf to keep her mind sharp and spirits high. Let's show this week who's boss!
